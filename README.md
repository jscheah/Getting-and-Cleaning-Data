# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Introduction

https://class.coursera.org/getdata-012/human_grading
There is just one script called `run_analysis.R`. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This is output to .\Data\output\tidy_data_set.txt

The `CodeBook.md` explains it more detailed.

## Run from command line

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the script: $ Rscript run_analysis.R
